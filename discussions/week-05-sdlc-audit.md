# Week 5 Discussion: IT Audit in the Systems Development Life Cycle

**Posted:** September 16, 2025 7:40 AM  
**Topic:** What is the benefit of having an IT auditor as part of the system implementation team? What role can IT Audit play in various phases of the SDLC? Why is project management "part art and part science"?

## Response

From my perspective, having an IT auditor on the implementation team makes total sense - it's like having someone who speaks both the technical language and the compliance language, which seems super important given how complex systems are today.

### Benefits of IT Auditor Integration

The main benefit I see is catching issues when they're still cheap to fix. Back home, I saw a government project fail because nobody checked if it met regulatory requirements until the very end - they had to rebuild everything! According to AuditBoard (2023), companies with IT auditors embedded in their teams reduce post-implementation issues by about 35%. That's not just about saving money; it's about protecting the organization's reputation too. IT auditors bring this unique perspective where they're constantly asking "what could go wrong?" while developers are focused on "how do we make this work?"

### IT Audit Role Across SDLC Phases

Looking at the SDLC phases, IT auditors contribute differently at each stage. In the **planning phase**, they review feasibility studies and identify risks early. During **analysis and design**, they ensure security and compliance requirements are baked in, not added as an afterthought. In **development**, they monitor if coding standards are being followed (ISACA, 2011). The **testing phase** is where they really shine - verifying not just that the system works, but that it's secure and compliant. After **deployment**, they help with ongoing monitoring. What I find most valuable is how they document everything, creating an audit trail that protects everyone involved.

### Project Management: Art and Science

The idea that project management is "part art and part science" makes perfect sense to me now. The **science side** includes all the frameworks - Agile, Waterfall, PMBOK guidelines, Gantt charts, and risk matrices. These give structure and measurability. But the **art side**? That's about reading people, knowing when to push and when to compromise, and handling unexpected situations creatively.

I experienced this firsthand during our capstone project last semester. We had all the project management tools, but when two team members had a conflict about the database design, no framework told us how to handle it. It took emotional intelligence and negotiation - the "art" part - to find a solution everyone could accept. As noted by Wysocki (2019), successful project managers must blend systematic approaches with intuitive problem-solving, adapting their style to team dynamics, organizational culture, and project constraints. You can follow every methodology perfectly, but if you can't motivate your team or navigate office politics, the project will still struggle.

The science gives you the roadmap; the art helps you navigate the detours. Both are essential, and I think that's why experienced project managers are so valuable - they've developed both skill sets through years of practice.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Early defect detection** - IT auditors reduce post-implementation issues by ~35%
2. **Compliance integration** - Ensures requirements are built-in, not bolted-on
3. **Risk identification** - Proactive "what could go wrong?" perspective throughout SDLC
4. **Audit trail creation** - Documentation protects all stakeholders
5. **Science = Methodologies** - Frameworks, tools, processes provide structure
6. **Art = Adaptation** - Emotional intelligence, negotiation, situational judgment
7. **Combined approach** - Both science and art required for project success

## Frameworks Referenced

- AuditBoard post-implementation metrics (2023)
- ISACA IT audit best practices (2011)
- PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)
- Agile/Waterfall methodologies
- Wysocki project management research (2019)

## Reflection

This discussion changed my perspective on when auditors should engage. I initially thought auditors only came in after implementation to "check the work." Understanding their value during development - as partners rather than gatekeepers - shows how mature organizations integrate quality and compliance from the start. It's preventive medicine versus emergency room visits.
