## Response

Hello everyone! My name is Noble Antwi, and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics here at Illinois Tech. Coming into this IT Auditing course, I have to admit I'm both excited and a bit nervous - auditing always seemed like this mysterious world where you need to know everything about technology AND business, which is intimidating but also exactly why I'm here.

My background is actually in information systems, and I've spent some time working with network security and incident response. What really got me interested in IT auditing was seeing how often security incidents happen not because of sophisticated hacks, but because of basic control failures that should have been caught. That's when I realized that good auditing isn't just about checking boxes - it's about genuinely understanding risk and helping organizations get better before something goes wrong.

What I'm hoping to get from this course is pretty straightforward: I want to understand how professional auditors actually think through complex IT environments. I've read about frameworks like COBIT and NIST, but applying them to real situations is completely different from reading about them. I'm also really interested in learning how to communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders, because from what I've seen, that's where a lot of audit work succeeds or fails.

Outside of school and work, I'm honestly pretty low-key. I'm a huge football fan (the real football, not American football - sorry!), and I spend way too much time following the Premier League even though the time difference is brutal for watching matches live. I also really enjoy cooking, especially trying to recreate dishes from back home in Ghana. It's therapeutic after a long day of studying.

I'm looking forward to learning from everyone in this class. I know we all come from different backgrounds, and I think that diversity of experience is going to make our discussions way more interesting than if we all thought the same way.

Thanks for reading, and I'm excited to work with you all this semester!
