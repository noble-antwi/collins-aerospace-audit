### Executive Summary

Conducted a comprehensive IT risk assessment of the University ITMM IT Audit's Banner Finance system, which manages all financial, accounting, HR, and payroll operations for a university serving 15,000 students and hundreds of staff members.

**Overall Risk Rating:** HIGH

**Risk Distribution:**

- 3 Very High Risks
- 7 High Risks
- 5 Moderate Risks
- 3 Low Risks

### Key Deliverables

**NIST Required Tables (8 completed):**

- Table D-7: Adversarial Threat Sources
- Table D-8: Non-Adversarial Threat Sources
- Table E-5: Threat Events (Adversarial and Non-Adversarial)
- Table F-3: Vulnerabilities
- Table F-6: Predisposing Conditions
- Table H-4: Adverse Impacts
- Table I-5: Adversarial Risk (detailed analysis)
- Table I-7: Non-Adversarial Risk (detailed analysis)

### Critical Findings

**Top Vulnerabilities Identified:**

1. No offsite backup storage - All backups in same Florida coastal facility
2. Weak password policies - 8-character minimum, no complexity requirements
3. Delayed account termination - Up to 30 days for terminated users
4. No change control approval - Direct production changes without review
5. Inadequate access reviews - No periodic user access review procedures

**Threat Analysis:**

- 7 Adversarial threats (cybercriminals, insider threats, hacktivists)
- 5 Non-adversarial threats (hurricanes, human error, system failures)
- 18 distinct risk scenarios evaluated

**Full Report:** [Assignment_2_Answer.pdf](assignment-02-risk-assessment/supporting-files/Assignemnt%202%20-%20Answer.pdf)

**Summary:** [README.md](assignment-02-risk-assessment/README.md)

**Skills Demonstrated:**

## Assignment 3: Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

**Presentation Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Duration:** 15 minutes

### Executive Summary

Delivered a comprehensive presentation on Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery best practices from an IT audit perspective, analyzing real-world disasters and providing actionable BC/DR guidance for IT organizations.

**Presentation Title:** "When Systems Fail: BCP/DR Best Practices from an IT Audit Perspective"

### Primary Case Study: CrowdStrike Global Outage

**Event Details:**

- **Date:** July 19, 2024, 4:09 AM UTC
- **Type:** Software update failure (human-made disaster)
- **Impact:** 8.5 million Windows systems in 78 minutes
- **Financial Loss:** $5.4 billion to Fortune 500 companies

### Prescient Timing

This presentation was delivered on November 4, 2025, analyzing the July 2024 CrowdStrike incident. Five weeks later (early December 2025), the Collins Aerospace audit revealed remarkably similar BC/DR control failures:

| CrowdStrike Issue | Collins Aerospace Finding |

|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Inadequate testing procedures | Finding #3: Incident Response gaps |
| No offsite/air-gapped backups | Finding #4: Backup strategy deficiencies |
| Poor change management | Implied in multiple findings |
| RTO/RPO not tested | Finding #4: Recovery capabilities unverified |
| Communication breakdown | Finding #3: Escalation procedure gaps |
