### Acknowledgments

This comprehensive IT audit project would not have been possible without the guidance and support of several individuals and organizations:

**Professor Ann Rangarajan** deserves special recognition for her exceptional instruction in IT auditing principles, frameworks, and methodologies. Her emphasis on practical application of theoretical concepts, real-world case studies, and professional standards shaped our approach to this audit engagement. The knowledge gained from ITMM 586 provided the foundation for every aspect of this work.

**Krupa Prakash Panchal**, my audit partner throughout this engagement, contributed significantly to the planning, fieldwork, and reporting phases. The collaboration demonstrated in this repository reflects our joint commitment to audit excellence and professional standards.

**Illinois Institute of Technology** provided the academic environment and resources necessary to pursue graduate-level study in cybersecurity and IT auditing. The program's focus on emerging technologies, risk management, and governance frameworks directly enabled this comprehensive analysis.

**Industry Organizations** whose frameworks and standards guided our work:
- **ISACA** for COBIT 2019 and professional ethics standards
- **NIST** for Special Publications 800-30, 800-53, 800-171, 800-172 and the Cybersecurity Framework
- **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Accreditation Body** for CMMC 2.0 guidance
- **AICPA** for audit methodologies and professional standards
- **IIA (Institute of Internal Auditors)** for GTAG guidance

**Professional Community** - The IT auditing and cybersecurity community whose shared knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned from real-world incidents informed our recommendations and analysis.

### Special Thanks

To our families, friends, and colleagues who supported us throughout this intensive academic project, thank you for your patience and encouragement.

## Hypothetical Nature of Audit

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**

While this repository is based on:
- Publicly available information about Collins Aerospace
- Real industry frameworks and standards
- Actual cybersecurity best practices
- Authentic audit methodologies

The specific audit findings, test results, and internal details are:
- **Hypothetical** and created for educational purposes
- **Not based on actual audit access** to Collins Aerospace systems
- **Not representative of Collins Aerospace's actual security posture**
- **Not endorsed or reviewed** by Collins Aerospace or RTX Corporation

This is an academic exercise demonstrating IT audit principles, not an actual assessment of Collins Aerospace's controls.
