## 📋 REMAINING TASKS (For You to Complete)

### 1. Copy PDFs to Repository
Copy your assignment PDF files to appropriate directories:

```bash
# Assignment 2 PDF
cp /mnt/project/Assignemnt_2_-_Answer.pdf \
   /home/claude/collins-aerospace-audit/assignments/assignment-02-risk-assessment/supporting-files/

# Assignment 3 PDF  
cp /mnt/project/Assignment_3__Answer.pdf \
   /home/claude/collins-aerospace-audit/assignments/assignment-03-disaster-recovery/supporting-files/

# Supporting files (optional)

   /home/claude/collins-aerospace-audit/assignments/assignment-02-risk-assessment/supporting-files/
   
cp /mnt/project/Assignment_3_Fall_2025.pdf \
   /home/claude/collins-aerospace-audit/assignments/assignment-03-disaster-recovery/supporting-files/
```

### 2. Update Main README.md
Insert the content from `MAIN_README_COURSEWORK_SECTION.md` into your main `README.md`:
- Location: After "Repository Structure" section
- Before "Assignments and Findings" section

### 3. Optional Enhancements
If you want to add cross-references in findings:

**In Finding #3 (Incident Response):**
```markdown
> The incident response failures identified mirror patterns observed in the July 2024 
> CrowdStrike outage (Week 8 Discussion, Assignment 3), where inadequate testing and 
> communication breakdowns created cascading global impacts.
```

**In Finding #4 (Backup/DR):**
```markdown
> This finding directly applies disaster recovery principles from Week 9 Discussion and 
> Assignment 3. The 3-2-1-1-0 backup rule and RTO/RPO concepts explored during the 
> CrowdStrike presentation demonstrate prescient awareness of vulnerabilities that 
> materialized at Collins just 5 weeks later.
```

### 4. Update INDEX.md
Add discussions and assignments sections:

```markdown
## Discussions
- [Weekly Discussions Overview](discussions/README.md)
- [Week 1: Introduction](discussions/week-01-introduction.md)

```

### 5. Update CHANGELOG.md

```markdown
### [1.3.0] - 2025-12-22
#### Added
- Complete weekly discussions (12 files, 10,611 words)
