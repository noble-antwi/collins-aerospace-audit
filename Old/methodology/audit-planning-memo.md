# IT Audit Planning Memorandum
## Collins Aerospace - FY 2026 Cybersecurity & Controls Assessment

**MEMORANDUM**

**Date:** November 8, 2025

**To:** Executive Leadership Team - Collins Aerospace  
**From:** Noble Antwi & Krupa Prakash Panchal, IT Audit Team  
**Subject:** Proposed IT Audit - FY 2026 Cybersecurity & Controls Assessment

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are requesting approval to conduct a comprehensive IT audit focused on cybersecurity controls and regulatory compliance. Recent industry incidents, upcoming CMMC requirements, and SOX compliance obligations make this audit critical for maintaining our competitive position and meeting customer expectations.

**Bottom Line:** This 12-week audit will cost approximately $271,000 but could prevent potential losses of $10-50M from regulatory penalties, cyber incidents, or contract losses.

## BACKGROUND AND BUSINESS CONTEXT

Collins Aerospace, formed in 2018 through the merger of UTC Aerospace Systems and Rockwell Collins, operates as a leading supplier of aerospace and defense systems. With approximately $28.28 billion in annual revenue and 80,000 employees globally, the company represents 34% of RTX Corporation's total business.

The company operates in a highly regulated environment where technology failures can have significant operational, financial, and reputational consequences. Recent industry incidents, including supply chain compromises and ransomware attacks affecting aerospace companies, have highlighted the importance of robust IT governance frameworks and cybersecurity controls.

### Critical Business Dependencies

Collins Aerospace's IT infrastructure supports:
- **Manufacturing Operations:** Advanced manufacturing systems and industrial control systems
- **Commercial Aviation:** Flight control systems, avionics, and cabin management systems
- **Defense Systems:** Secure communications, mission systems, and classified program support
- **Supply Chain Management:** Global supplier network and logistics systems
- **Financial Reporting:** Enterprise systems supporting SOX compliance requirements

---

## AUDIT OBJECTIVES

The proposed audit will focus on four primary objectives aligned with Collins Aerospace's strategic priorities:

### 1. Operational Resilience Assessment
Evaluate the adequacy of IT controls supporting manufacturing operations, supply chain management, and customer delivery commitments. This includes:
- Business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities
- Backup systems and data protection controls
- Single points of failure analysis
- Manufacturing system resilience (OT/ICS environments)

### 2. Cybersecurity Posture Evaluation
Assess the organization's defensive capabilities against cyber threats, including:
- Network security architecture and segmentation
- Endpoint detection and response capabilities
- Security incident response procedures and CSIRT effectiveness
- Vulnerability management and patch management processes
- Employee security awareness and training programs

### 3. Regulatory Compliance Verification
Review compliance with applicable regulations and standards:
- **CMMC Level 3 Certification:** Required for defense contracts by Q2 2026
- **SOX Section 404:** IT general controls over financial reporting
- **Export Controls:** ITAR/EAR technical safeguards implementation
- **Industry Standards:** FAA, DoD, and other regulatory requirements

### 4. Governance and Risk Management Review
Examine IT governance structures and risk management processes:
- IT governance framework and oversight mechanisms
- Risk assessment and management processes
- Technology investment decision-making
- Vendor and third-party risk management
- Board and executive-level IT risk reporting

---

## KEY RISK AREAS IDENTIFIED

Based on preliminary risk assessment and industry analysis, the following areas have been identified as high-priority for audit focus:

### 1. CMMC Compliance Gap (CRITICAL RISK)

**Issue:** Defense contracts require CMMC Level 3 certification by Q2 2026. Preliminary assessment indicates potential gaps in access controls, incident response capabilities, and supply chain security management.

**Business Impact:** 
- $2.3 billion in defense contract renewals at risk
- Competitive disadvantage if certification delayed
- Potential contract termination for non-compliance

**Audit Focus:**
- Gap analysis against NIST SP 800-171 (Level 2 requirements)
- Assessment of NIST SP 800-172 enhanced controls (Level 3 specific)
- Vendor security requirements flow-down
- Documentation and evidence collection readiness

### 2. Ransomware and Business Continuity (HIGH RISK)

**Issue:** Aerospace industry has been targeted by ransomware attacks. Inadequate backup strategies and untested disaster recovery plans create vulnerability to operational disruption.

**Business Impact:**
- Potential multi-day manufacturing outage ($10M+ per day)
- Supply chain disruption affecting airline customers
- Reputational damage and customer confidence erosion
- Regulatory reporting requirements (SEC, customers)

**Audit Focus:**
- Air-gapped and immutable backup implementation
- Backup testing and restoration procedures
- Disaster recovery plan adequacy and testing
- Incident response capabilities and tabletop exercises

### 3. Industrial Control Systems Security (HIGH RISK)

**Issue:** OT/ICS systems in manufacturing facilities may not have adequate segmentation from IT networks or appropriate security controls.

**Business Impact:**
- Manufacturing disruption or safety incidents
- Product quality impacts
- Regulatory compliance issues (OSHA, EPA)
- Intellectual property theft risk

**Audit Focus:**
- OT/IT network segmentation and access controls
- ICS security lifecycle assessment (IEC 62443 alignment)
- Patch management for industrial systems
- Remote access controls to OT environments

### 4. Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)

**Issue:** Extensive vendor relationships and supply chain dependencies create potential attack vectors. Recent supply chain compromises in aerospace industry highlight vulnerability.

**Business Impact:**
- Supply chain disruption
- Data breach via vendor compromise
- Compliance violations (CMMC flow-down requirements)
- Intellectual property theft

**Audit Focus:**
- Vendor security assessment processes
- Third-party access controls and monitoring
- Contract security requirements and enforcement
- Supply chain cyber risk management program

### 5. SOX IT General Controls (MEDIUM RISK)

**Issue:** As a publicly traded company (via RTX), Collins Aerospace must maintain effective IT general controls supporting financial reporting systems.

**Business Impact:**
- Material weakness disclosure requirement
- Audit opinion qualification
- Sarbanes-Oxley compliance violations
- Investor confidence impact

**Audit Focus:**
- Change management controls for financial systems
- Access controls and segregation of duties
- Computer operations and backup controls
- Program development and change controls
