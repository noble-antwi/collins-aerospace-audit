### [Assignment 2: NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment](assignment-02-risk-assessment/)
**Weight:** 100 points  
**Completion Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Full Report:** [30-page PDF](assignment-02-risk-assessment/supporting-files/)

**Scenario:** University ITMM IT Audit - Banner Finance System

**Methodology:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 (Three-Tier Risk Assessment)

**Key Findings:**
- **Overall Risk Rating:** HIGH
- **18 Identified Risks:** 3 Very High, 7 High, 5 Moderate, 3 Low
- **Critical Vulnerabilities:** No offsite backups, weak passwords, delayed account termination
- **Geographic Risk:** Hurricane exposure (Florida coast)

**8 NIST Tables Completed:**
- D-7: Adversarial Threat Sources (7 sources)
- D-8: Non-Adversarial Threat Sources (10 sources)
- E-5: Threat Events (9 adversarial, 10 non-adversarial)
- F-3: Vulnerabilities (12 identified)
- F-6: Predisposing Conditions (10 conditions)
- H-4: Adverse Impacts (8 impact types)
- I-5: Adversarial Risk Analysis
- I-7: Non-Adversarial Risk Analysis

**Impact on Collins Audit:** Risk assessment methodology refined here directly informed the Collins Aerospace audit planning, particularly the three-tier approach and threat modeling.

### [Assignment 3: Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery](assignment-03-disaster-recovery/)
**Weight:** 100 points  
**Completion Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Presentation:** Tuesday, November 4, 2025 (15 min + 5 min Q&A)  
**Full Presentation:** [49-slide PDF](assignment-03-disaster-recovery/supporting-files/)

**Topic:** CrowdStrike Global Outage Analysis (July 19, 2024)

**Incident Scale:**
- 8.5 million Windows systems affected in 78 minutes
- $5.4 billion impact on Fortune 500 companies
- Fastest-spreading IT incident in history
- Global disruption: aviation, healthcare, banking, emergency services

**BC/DR Lessons Learned:**
1. Inadequate testing across diverse configurations
2. No staged/phased rollout procedures
3. Insufficient rollback capabilities
4. Communication breakdown at scale

**Prescient Timing:** Presentation delivered 5 weeks before Collins Aerospace audit, where remarkably similar control failures were identified (testing inadequacies, backup gaps, recovery procedure failures).

**Frameworks Applied:**
- NIST SP 800-34 (Contingency Planning Guide)
- 3-2-1-1-0 backup rule
- RTO/RPO metrics
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

## Learning Progression

The assignments demonstrate clear progression from theoretical understanding to practical application:

```
Assignment 1 (September)
↓ Establishes ethical framework and governance principles
Assignment 2 (September)  
↓ Develops risk identification and assessment skills
Assignment 3 (November)
↓ Analyzes disaster response and recovery planning
Final Project (November)
↓ Synthesizes all learning into comprehensive audit deliverable
```

## Integration with Weekly Discussions

Assignments were reinforced through 12 weekly discussions covering:
- Professional development (Week 3)
- Enterprise risk management (Week 4)
- SDLC audit integration (Week 5)
- Service management (Week 7)
- CrowdStrike incident analysis (Week 8)
- Disaster recovery planning (Week 9)
- ICS/OT security (Week 10)
- FBI threat landscape (Week 11)
- Social engineering (Week 13)

See [discussions/](../discussions/) for complete weekly responses.

## Connection to Final Project

Each assignment contributed specific skills to the Collins Aerospace audit:

| Assignment | Skills Developed | Application to Collins Audit |
|------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Assignment 1 | Ethical reasoning, Framework enhancement | Professional judgment, COBIT/CMMC frameworks |
| Assignment 2 | NIST risk assessment, Threat modeling | Audit planning, Risk identification methodology |
| Assignment 3 | BC/DR analysis, Incident lessons learned | Finding #4 (Backup/DR), Finding #3 (Incident Response) |

## Academic Rigor

All assignments demonstrate graduate-level work:
- **Comprehensive research:** 50+ academic and industry sources cited
- **Framework application:** NIST, COBIT, ISO, CMMC properly applied
- **Critical analysis:** Beyond description to evaluation and recommendation
- **Professional presentation:** Suitable for stakeholder consumption
- **Authentic student voice:** Personal reflection integrated with technical content
