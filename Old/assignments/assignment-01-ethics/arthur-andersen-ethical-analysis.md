## Arthur Andersen's Ethical Violations: A Critical Analysis

After thoroughly reviewing the Arthur Andersen case study and examining the professional codes of ethics from ISACA and AICPA, I found multiple, systematic violations that ultimately led to the firm's collapse. In my analysis, Arthur Andersen violated fundamental ethical principles across both organizations' codes, with the most egregious breaches occurring in areas of professional independence, integrity, and professional competence.

### Independence and Objectivity Violations

The most glaring ethical violation relates to independence requirements found in both ISACA's Code of Professional Ethics (which requires IS professionals to "be objective and independent in professional judgment") and AICPA's Professional Responsibilities (specifically independence standards for auditors). The case study provides compelling evidence of this violation through Andersen's relationship with Waste Management, where "many of Waste Management's internal accountants had been hired from Arthur Andersen, including virtually every chief financial officer and every chief accounting officer." This created what we learned in class as a "revolving door" situation that fundamentally compromised auditor independence.

Even more troubling was the firm's transformation into what partner Barbara Toffler observed as acting "like they were on the same team" with clients rather than maintaining the adversarial independence required for effective auditing. The 1996 party celebrating Waste Management's IPO anniversary exemplifies this - it seems to suggest that the lines between auditor and client had become dangerously blurred, which directly violates the objectivity principle both codes emphasize.

### Professional Competence and Due Care

Both ISACA and AICPA codes require professionals to maintain competence and exercise due professional care. The case study reveals systematic failures here, particularly in the Enron engagement where Andersen auditors consistently failed to challenge aggressive accounting practices. The removal of Carl Bass, who had been questioning Enron's accounting methods, at the client's request represents a shocking abandonment of professional skepticism. This seems to suggest that commercial considerations superseded professional judgment - a clear violation of due care requirements.

The Waste Management case provides another stark example where Andersen auditors identified questionable practices as early as 1988, such as overestimating salvage values of garbage trucks by 150% ($30,000 vs. actual $12,000), yet continued to sign off on the financials. This failure to exercise professional skepticism violates both codes' requirements for competent performance.

### Integrity and Professional Behavior

Perhaps most damaging to the profession was Andersen's violation of integrity principles. The systematic document shredding following the Enron collapse - over one ton of documents and 30,000 emails destroyed - represents a fundamental breach of integrity that both codes explicitly prohibit. The timing is particularly damning: the destruction occurred after David Duncan received Nancy Temple's memo about document retention, suggesting coordination rather than routine compliance.

What really strikes me about this case is how the pursuit of consulting revenue corrupted the firm's ethical foundation. By 2000, 51% of Big Five accounting firm revenue came from management consulting, creating what SEC Commissioner Arthur Levitt identified as inherent conflicts of interest. The case shows how Andersen used audits as "gateways to far more lucrative consulting arrangements," fundamentally altering the auditor-client relationship.

### Pattern of Violations

The case study reveals this wasn't isolated to Enron - there's a disturbing pattern across multiple clients including Baptist Foundation of Arizona ($217 million settlement), Sunbeam ($110 million settlement), and others. This suggests systemic ethical failures rather than individual lapses in judgment. The promotion of partners involved in the Waste Management scandal, particularly Robert Kutsenda to managing partner of global risk management despite receiving a suspension, demonstrates an organizational culture that rewarded commercial success over ethical compliance.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Arthur Andersen's violations span virtually every major ethical principle in both professional codes. The firm systematically prioritized revenue generation over professional responsibilities, compromised independence through consulting relationships, failed in due care obligations, and ultimately destroyed evidence to obstruct justice. This case serves as a powerful reminder of why these ethical codes exist and the catastrophic consequences when they're ignored. The firm's collapse wasn't just a business failure - it was a professional and ethical failure that damaged public trust in the entire auditing profession.

## Specific Code Violations Mapped

### ISACA Code of Professional Ethics

| ISACA Principle | Violation Example from Case Study |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Support the implementation and encourage compliance with appropriate standards and procedures** | Failed to enforce proper accounting standards at Waste Management; allowed $1.7B overstatement |
| **Perform their duties with due diligence and professional care** | Continued certifying Waste Management financials despite knowing of questionable practices since 1988 |
| **Serve in the interest of stakeholders in a lawful and honest manner** | Prioritized client relationships over public interest; acted as "team members" with clients |
| **Maintain the privacy and confidentiality of information obtained** | Document destruction (though technically obstruction, violated spirit of information protection) |
| **Maintain competency in their respective fields** | Failed to update risk management approaches; ignored red flags systematically |
| **Be objective and independent in professional judgment** | "Revolving door" employment with clients; consulting revenue conflicts |

### AICPA Professional Responsibilities

| AICPA Standard | Violation Example from Case Study |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Independence (Rule 101)** | $52M in fees from Enron (2000); consulting revenue exceeded audit fees |
| **Integrity and Objectivity (Rule 102)** | Removed Carl Bass at client request; subordinated judgment to client preferences |
| **General Standards (Rule 201)** | Failed to maintain professional skepticism; inadequate supervision evident |
| **Compliance with Standards (Rule 202)** | Departure from GAAS standards in multiple engagements |
| **Accounting Principles (Rule 203)** | Signed off on financials with material departures from GAAP (Waste Management) |
| **Confidential Client Information (Rule 301)** | Destruction of documents violated preservation requirements |
| **Contingent Fees (Rule 302)** | While not direct contingent fees, consulting arrangements created similar conflicts |
| **Acts Discreditable (Rule 501)** | Document destruction; obstruction of justice; multiple regulatory violations |

## Lessons Learned for IT Auditing

### Independence is Non-Negotiable
The Arthur Andersen case demonstrates that even perceived conflicts of interest can undermine audit effectiveness. For IT auditors, this means:
- Maintaining clear separation between consulting and audit services
- Avoiding long-term client relationships that blur objectivity
- Refusing client pressure to compromise professional judgment
- Documenting independence assessments formally

### Professional Skepticism Must Be Maintained
The failure to challenge client assertions cost Andersen its existence:
- Question management assumptions systematically
- Investigate red flags thoroughly regardless of client relationship
- Document concerns even when overruled
- Escalate disagreements to appropriate governance levels

### Integrity Cannot Be Compromised for Revenue
The consulting revenue chase corrupted Andersen's ethical foundation:
- Revenue targets should not drive professional decisions
- Audit quality must supersede commercial considerations
- Organizational culture must reward ethical behavior over financial performance
- Leadership accountability for ethical failures is essential

### Documentation and Evidence Preservation
The document destruction sealed Andersen's fate:
- Audit evidence must be preserved per retention requirements
- Destruction policies should be clear and consistently applied
- Electronic communications are discoverable and permanent
- Obstruction of justice can criminalize civil matters

## Contemporary Relevance

### Post-Enron Regulatory Changes
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002):** Direct response to Andersen failures
- **Section 201:** Prohibition on certain non-audit services
- **Section 203:** Mandatory audit partner rotation
- **Section 404:** Management assessment of internal controls
- **PCAOB Creation:** Oversight of audit firms

### Ongoing Professional Standards Evolution
- Enhanced independence requirements
- Stricter separation of audit and consulting
- Improved quality control standards
- Enhanced audit committee responsibilities
- Technology-specific audit standards (relevant for IT auditing)

### IT Auditing Implications
As IT auditors, we must recognize that:
- Technology systems are increasingly material to financial reporting
- IT consulting and IT auditing must maintain independence
- Professional ethics apply equally to IT and financial auditing
- Emerging technologies (AI, cloud, blockchain) create new ethical challenges
- ISACA Code of Professional Ethics directly governs our professional conduct
