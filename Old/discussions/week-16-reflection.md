## Response

As I reflect on this semester in ITMM 586, several topics stand out as areas where I want to deepen my knowledge and expertise moving forward.

### Areas for Continued Learning

**1. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security**

The Week 10 discussion on ICS/OT security opened my eyes to a completely different world of IT auditing. Unlike traditional IT systems where confidentiality might be paramount, ICS environments prioritize availability and safety - an audit failure could literally cause physical harm or environmental damage. The Colonial Pipeline and Oldsmar Water Treatment incidents demonstrated that these aren't theoretical concerns.

I'm particularly interested in learning IEC 62443 standards in depth and understanding how to audit air-gapped systems, legacy equipment that can't be patched, and the unique risk assessment methodologies required when physical safety is at stake. Given the increasing convergence of IT and OT environments, this expertise will only become more valuable.

**2. AI and Machine Learning in IT Auditing**

Assignment 1's COBIT enhancement work highlighted how AI is transforming governance frameworks, but I want to explore the practical application side more deeply. How are audit firms using machine learning for anomaly detection in log files? How can natural language processing help analyze policies and contracts? What are the ethical considerations when AI makes audit sampling decisions?

The flip side is also fascinating - how do we audit AI systems themselves? As organizations deploy more AI-driven decision-making, auditors need methodologies to evaluate algorithmic bias, model transparency, and AI governance controls. This feels like uncharted territory that will define the next generation of IT auditing.

**3. Cloud Security and DevSecOps Auditing**

The course touched on cloud concepts, but I realize my understanding of how to audit cloud-native architectures is superficial. Modern organizations use Infrastructure-as-Code, serverless functions, containers, and microservices - none of which fit traditional audit approaches designed for on-premise data centers.

I'm particularly curious about auditing DevOps pipelines where code moves from development to production in minutes, not months. How do you evaluate controls in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments? What does "separation of duties" mean when infrastructure is defined in code?

### Why These Topics Matter

These three areas share a common theme: they represent the frontier of IT auditing where traditional methodologies need adaptation. ICS security deals with convergence of cyber and physical risks. AI introduces opaque, probabilistic decision-making that challenges conventional audit techniques. Cloud and DevOps fundamentally restructure how IT operates, making many legacy controls obsolete.

As IT auditing evolves, the ability to assess these modern environments will separate truly valuable auditors from those simply checking compliance boxes. I want to be in the former category.

### Learning Plan

My plan for continued education includes:

- **GICSP (Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional)** certification to complement CISA
- **Cloud security courses** (AWS Security, Azure Security, GCP Security)
- **IEC 62443** formal training
- **AI governance frameworks** research (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF beyond Assignment 1)
- **Hands-on practice** - Setting up homelab environments to experiment with Docker, Kubernetes, and ICS simulators

### Course Impact

This semester transformed my view of IT auditing from "people who check if you're following rules" to "strategic advisors who help organizations understand and manage technology risks." The progression from ethics (Assignment 1) through risk assessment (Assignment 2) and disaster recovery (Assignment 3) to the comprehensive Collins Aerospace audit showed how these pieces fit together in practice.

The weekly discussions were particularly valuable for exposing me to real-world incidents and emerging threats. The CrowdStrike analysis (Week 8) that we did in October became eerily relevant when we analyzed the Collins incident in November - same failure patterns, same lessons learned, different victim.

### Final Thoughts

IT auditing sits at a fascinating intersection of technology, business, and risk management. This course gave me foundational knowledge, but I'm hungry to specialize in the emerging areas that will shape the profession's future. The threat landscape evolves constantly - our expertise must evolve just as quickly.

## Key Takeaways

1. **ICS/OT security** represents unique audit challenges with physical safety implications
2. **AI in auditing** offers both tools (for auditors) and subjects (auditing AI systems)
3. **Cloud and DevOps** require new audit methodologies for modern architectures
4. **Continuous learning** essential as technology and threats evolve
5. **Specialization** in emerging areas creates professional differentiation
6. **Practical experience** (labs, simulations) complements theoretical knowledge

## Course Journey Reflection

**September:** Ethics and governance foundations
**October:** Risk assessment and operational controls
**November:** BC/DR, advanced threats, comprehensive audit project
**December:** Synthesis and future planning

This progression from theory to practice, simple to complex, made the learning journey logical and cumulative.

## Gratitude

Thank you to Professor Rangarajan for designing a course that balanced theoretical frameworks with practical application. The Collins Aerospace audit project brought everything together and gave me confidence that I can conduct real-world IT audits. Thank you to my classmates for thought-provoking discussions and different perspectives. And thank you to my project partner Krupa for excellent collaboration on the final audit.

This isn't the end of learning - it's just the foundation.
