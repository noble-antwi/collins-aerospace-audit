## Direct Impact on Collins Aerospace Audit

Several weekly discussions directly informed the final audit deliverable:

| Discussion Topic | Application to Audit |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Week 8: CrowdStrike Incident | Findings #3 (Incident Response) & #4 (Backup/DR) |
| Week 9: Disaster Recovery | Finding #4 - 3-2-1-1-0 backup rule, RTO/RPO concepts |
| Week 11: FBI Threat Landscape | Threat modeling in audit planning memo |
| Week 13: Social Engineering | Finding #1 - MFA implementation weaknesses |

The CrowdStrike analysis (Week 8) proved particularly prescient - delivered on October 6, 2025, just weeks before analyzing the September 2024 Collins Aerospace ransomware incident. The parallels in testing failures, backup inadequacies, and recovery procedure gaps validated the discussion's risk assessment.

## Statistics

- **Total Discussions:** 12+ substantive responses
- **Word Count:** 3,600+ words of analysis
- **References Cited:** 50+ academic and industry sources
- **Topics Covered:** Ethics, Risk Management, SDLC, Service Management, BC/DR, ICS Security, Social Engineering
- **Peer Engagement:** Active participation in Q&A and peer reviews

## Integration with Course Learning Outcomes

These discussions complemented formal assignments by:

1. **Applying theoretical frameworks** - NIST, COBIT, IEC standards to real scenarios
2. **Analyzing current events** - CrowdStrike, FBI advisories, emerging attack vectors
3. **Developing professional judgment** - Ethical reasoning, risk assessment decisions
4. **Building technical vocabulary** - Industry terminology and frameworks
5. **Engaging with practitioners** - Learning from documented incidents and responses

## Connection to Academic Progression

```
Weekly Discussions (Continuous Learning)
    ↓
Assignment 1: Ethics & COBIT Enhancement
    ↓
Assignment 2: NIST Risk Assessment
    ↓
Assignment 3: BC/DR Presentation (CrowdStrike)
    ↓
Final Project: Collins Aerospace Comprehensive Audit
```

The discussions provided continuous reinforcement of concepts that were formally assessed through assignments and the final audit project. Topics explored informally (like the CrowdStrike incident) later became central to audit findings and recommendations.

## Sources & References

All discussions include proper academic and industry citations following APA format:
- Academic journals (Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, International Journal of Accounting IS)
- Industry reports (Verizon DBIR, FBI IC3, Gartner, Forrester)
- Professional organizations (ISACA, IIA, AICPA)
- Government agencies (NIST, CISA, FBI)
- Cybersecurity vendors (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, UpGuard)
