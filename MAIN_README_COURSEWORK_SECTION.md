## Complete Academic Portfolio - Fall 2025 Semester

This repository represents the culmination of a comprehensive semester of IT auditing coursework at Illinois Institute of Technology, progressing from foundational ethics and frameworks through risk assessment and disaster recovery analysis to a real-world post-incident audit.

### Course Deliverables Timeline

### Weekly Discussions Integration

Throughout the semester, [12+ weekly discussions](discussions/) (3,600+ words, 50+ citations) reinforced concepts:
- **Week 3:** Professional certifications (CIA, CISA, CPA) and organizations (IIA, AICPA, ISACA)
- **Week 4:** Enterprise Risk Management terminology and cyber insurance adoption
- **Week 5:** IT audit integration in SDLC - "part art and part science"
- **Week 7:** Service management tools and problem management processes
- **Week 8:** CrowdStrike incident analysis (October) → Informed Collins audit (November)
- **Week 9:** Disaster recovery planning - 8 DRP components, RTO/RPO concepts
- **Week 10:** ICS/OT security - Physical consequences, IEC 62443 standards
- **Week 11:** FBI threat landscape - Infrastructure targeting, audit tools
- **Week 13:** Social engineering - Deepfakes, $25M Arup scam, AI-powered attacks
- **Week 16:** Course reflection and future learning interests

### Learning Progression Demonstrated

```
ETHICS & GOVERNANCE (Assignment 1)
↓ Established principles of auditor independence and AI governance
RISK ASSESSMENT SKILLS (Assignment 2)  
↓ Developed NIST-based threat modeling and risk quantification
BC/DR PLANNING (Assignment 3)
↓ Analyzed real-world disaster response and recovery failures
COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT (Final Project)
↓ Synthesized all learning into professional post-incident assessment
```

### Direct Application - Theory to Practice

| Course Learning | Collins Aerospace Application |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Week 8 Discussion:** CrowdStrike testing failures | **Finding #3:** Incident Response - Detection/communication gaps |
| **Week 9 Discussion:** DRP components, 3-2-1-1-0 rule | **Finding #4:** Backup/DR - No air-gapped backups |
| **Week 11 Discussion:** FBI threats, audit tools | **Audit Planning:** Threat modeling, tool selection |
| **Week 13 Discussion:** Social engineering, MFA | **Finding #1:** MFA implementation weaknesses |
| **Assignment 2:** NIST SP 800-30 methodology | **Audit Memo:** Three-tier risk assessment framework |
| **Assignment 3:** RTO/RPO testing requirements | **Finding #4:** Recovery capabilities never tested |

### Prescient Analysis Validation

The **Assignment 3 presentation (November 4)** analyzed July 2024's CrowdStrike outage, identifying:
- Inadequate testing procedures
- No offsite/air-gapped backups  
- Poor change management
- RTO/RPO not tested
- Communication breakdown

**Five weeks later**, the Collins Aerospace audit revealed **identical control failures**, validating the theoretical analysis with real-world evidence.

### Academic Rigor & Professional Quality
